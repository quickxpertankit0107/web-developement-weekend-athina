// "use strict" is a directive (not a statement) that enables strict mode in JavaScript.
// It tells the JS engine to run your code in a "safer" and more restricted way.

// in non-strict mode, when you assign a value to a 
// variable that hasn't been declared (no var, no let, or no const).
// JavaScript implicitly creates a global variable.global means accessable from anywhere.
