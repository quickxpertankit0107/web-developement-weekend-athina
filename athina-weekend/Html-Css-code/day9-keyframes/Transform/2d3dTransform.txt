2D Transforms 2D transforms involve transformations on the X and Y axes, such as 
translation,
rotation,
scaling, and skewing.

1)translate(x, y) – Moves from X and Y axes.
selector {
  transform: translate(50px, 100px);
}

2)rotate(deg) – Rotates the element around a 2D point
selector {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}

3)scale(x, y) – Scales the element by x and y along the horizontal and vertical axes.
selector {
  transform: scale(1.5, 2);
}

4)skew(x, y) – Skews the element along X and Y axes.
selector {
  transform: skew(30deg, 20deg);
}

3D Transforms
3D transforms involve transformations along X, Y, and Z axes. 
In addition to basic transformations like translate, rotate, scale, and skew, 
3D transforms also include perspective, which creates depth and makes the transformations 
looks realistic.

1)translate3d(x, y, z) – Moves the element along X, Y, and Z axes.
selector {
  transform: translate3d(50px, 100px, 200px);
}

2)
rotateX(deg) – Rotates the element around the X axis.
rotateY(deg) – Rotates the element around the Y axis.
rotateZ(deg) – Rotates the element around the Z axis it is similar to the 2D rotate().
selector {
  transform: rotateX(45deg) rotateY(30deg) rotateZ(10deg);
}

3)scale3d(x, y, z) – Scales the element along X, Y, and Z axes.
selector {
  transform: scale3d(1.5, 1.5, 2);
}

4)
3D skew effect, but it’s implemented differently compared to 2D skew. 
While 2D skewing happens along the X and Y axes, 3D skewing 
involves skewing along the X, Y, and Z axes. 
However, there's no direct skew3d() function in CSS. 
Instead, you can achieve a 3D skew effect using matrix3d()

3D skew
The matrix3d() function is used for applying a 3D transformation to an element. 
It allows you to define the transformation using a 4x4 matrix, 
which consists of 16 values.
syntax:
matrix3d(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p)

5)perspective(value) – Defines how far the 3D element is from the viewer, 
affecting the depth effect.
